# Ishan Kasam Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is the shape of a business card, and it uses an NFC chip to transmit a link of choice when held against a phone. My card is going open up my personal website which would act as a resume for myself, and I can use it while applying for jobs or interships.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost around $20, but the card itself only costs $2
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Some challenges I faced during the design process were trying to get the routing of the traces to not interfere, but I recieved help from a mentor and overcame it.
